Hi,

My name is Markus and I've been working as a software engineer for the last few years, working as an integration engineer before that ðŸ˜ƒ

I've been working as an embedded C++ SW engineer for about a year until I started at my current workplace as fullstack SW engineer where I've transitioned into a tech lead role since November.

All the best,
Markus T
