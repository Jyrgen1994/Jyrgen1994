Hi,

My name is Markus and I've been working as a software engineer for the last few years, working as an integration engineer before that ğŸ˜ƒ

I've been working as an embedded C++ SW engineer for about a year until a started my current work as fullstack SW engineer at my current position where I've transitioned into a tech lead role.

All the best,
Markus T
